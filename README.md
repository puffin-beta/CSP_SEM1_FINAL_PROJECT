# CSP_SEM1_FINAL_PROJECT
This is my passion project (once a school project). This is a website that gives information on the combat aspect of the video game Minecraft.
This website gives a broad overview of combat in Minecraft. It has a PHP form and an SQL database retrival for information on hostile mobs
as the most complex component of the website. The website also features a responsive pictoral navigation menu on the home page, and 
multiple sub-pages to explain all the information.


Note: All information is based around Minecraft version 1.19. All information
presented in the site is from the Minecraft Fandom Website and images from Google Images.
